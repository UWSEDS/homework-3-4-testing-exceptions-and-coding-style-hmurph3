# Homework 3-4: Coding style and Unit tests.

**Note: This homework is double credit.**

In this homework, you will create two python modules.

1. Function code (5 points). Last week you wrote python codes that read an online file and created a data frame that has at least 3 columns. Now: (a) create a python module ``dataframe.py`` that reads the data in homework 2;  and (b) ``dataframpe.py`` should generate an ValueError execption if the dataframe doesn't have the expected column names.

1. Test code (5 points). Create a python file ``test_dataframe.py`` that has unit tests for dataframe.py. Include at least 2 of the following tests:

   - You have the expected columns.
   - Values in the column are all of the expected type.
   - There are no nan values.
   - The dataframe has at least one row.
   
1. Coding style (4). Make all codes PEP8 compliant and provide the output from pylint to demonstrate that you have accomplished this.
